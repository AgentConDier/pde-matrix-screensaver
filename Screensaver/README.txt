  '- Just don't sell it or anything. Also don't expect me to be responsible if you break your computer with this.
     Not that that should not be very possible

Installation: Unzip this archive in a safe place like C:\Program Files\Matrix
              right-click on matrix.scr -> install

When updating, do keep your matrix/data/config.txt around so you don't have to set it all up again

You're gonna want to have java installed for this. I do hope you know where to get it.

The screensaver gets a .json file containing some info about updates from my server, so your ip address may show up in my access logs. If you feel uneasy about that, adding the following to matrix/data/config.txt will help:
checkUpdate       false
